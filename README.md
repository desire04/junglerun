# JUNGLE RUN
Jungle run is an infinite runner based off of Temple run and subway surfers and the likes. In jungle run, the character the player controls is sonic and it is being chased by a venomtooth tiger. Sonic has to avoid rocks and shrubs by jumping with the up arrow key. If sonic hits an obstacle, it slows down, thus making it susceptible to get caught by the tiger. There are 3 modes of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. In easy mode, there's only 1 obstacle and there are no powerups. Also, sonic has 4 lives. In medium mode, there are 2 obstacles and 1 power up - a shield. Anytime sonic has the shield, it doesn't slow down if it runs into an obstacle. The shield is active for 5 seconds. Sonic also has 3 lives. In hard mode, sonic has 2 lives and 2 powerups: the shield and life rings. Each time sonic loses a life, it can pick up a life ring to gain it back. Note that sonic cannot accumulate life rings. This means that sonic cannot have more than 2 lives in hard mode. Every time the tiger catches sonic, sonic loses a life. The game ends when sonic runs out of lives. 
Other interesting features include double and triple jump, which are triggered by pressing the up arrow key button twice and thrice respectively.
